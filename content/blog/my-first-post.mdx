# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post. I'm excited to share my thoughts, learnings, and experiences in software development.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **Technical tutorials** - Deep dives into technologies I'm working with
- **Project updates** - Progress on my side projects and open source work
- **Career insights** - Lessons learned throughout my software engineering journey

## Code Example

Here's a simple TypeScript function to get us started:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my blog.`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## What's Next

Stay tuned for more content! I'm planning to write about React, TypeScript, and building performant web applications.

Thanks for reading!
